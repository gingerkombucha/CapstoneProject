# CapstoneProject
The Environmental Kuznet’s Curve (EKC) proposed by the founder of modern economic science Simon Smith Kuznets basically states that the “solution to pollution is economic growth.” The EKC has been heavily criticized; there is, however, evidence for its support, especially in areas of air and water pollution, as well as deforestation. 

# Data
The data used for the prediction and analysis of Environmental Quality Score based on GDPpc and other factors was obtained from Yale’s Environmental Performance Index (EPI) produced jointly by Yale University and Columbia University in collaboration with the World Economic Forum.

Two different datasets were used: 

1.	2018 EPI Country Snapshot
2.	2018 EPI Regional Comparisons
